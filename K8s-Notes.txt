1. To create deployment object once again with image from docker hub
  
  kubectl create deployment first-app --image=bhoirmakarand/kubernetes-starter-app
  kubectl get deployment
  kubectl get pods

2. To exposes pods to the cluster or externally we used service object. Pods has internal IP address that gets change very often. Services group pods with shared IP address. Services can allow external access to pods.
Without services, pods are very hard to reach and communication is difficult. Reaching a pod from outside the cluster is not possible at all without service

  kubectl expose deployment first-app --type=LoadBalancer --port 8080
  kubectl get services

3. To test application use
    http://external-ip:port

4. To scale-up
  kubectl scale deployment/first-app --replicas=3
  kubectl get pods

5. To attach AKS with azure container registry
az aks update -n <aks-cluster-name> -g <resource-group-name> --attach-acr <acr-name>
